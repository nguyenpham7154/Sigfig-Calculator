SIGNIFICANT FIGURES CALCULATOR

Joe is a struggling grade 11 student at Bolonel Cy.
Joe is trash at significant figures since he is sloppy.
His grades are taking Ls, his science teachers have been unforgiving, and an *ss-whooping from his parents is imminent.

This project aims to assist Joe by developing a calculator tool to relieve him of the misery of sigfigs.
We are dedicated to rescuing Joe's *ss and his credits.

Please support our cause!
